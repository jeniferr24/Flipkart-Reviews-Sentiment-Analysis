# Flipkart-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis

Libraries I had used for this are: NLTK Library (Natural Language Processing Library), Seaborn Library (Visualization Library), Wordcloud Library, Stopword library etc.
Used Stemming to preprocess the data.The SnowballStemmer algorithm was used for this Stemming process.
Cleaned the data for the purpose to clean and preprocess text data in the "Review" column by removing special characters, URLs, punctuation, stopwords, and applying stemming. 
The pie chart will represent the distribution of ratings in your dataset, with each segment of the pie corresponding to a different rating value, and the size of each segment representing the proportion of that rating in the dataset.
